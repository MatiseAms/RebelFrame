RebelFrame
==========

Small bundle of reusable libs to make working with Titanium even easier.

Usage:

Download files and put them in the app/lib/RebelFrame folder. Or add this repository as a submodule to app/lib/RebelFrame. A submodule always needs it own folder, that is why this repository does not have it's own sub directory. Otherwise files need to be included via `require(Rebelframe/Rebelframe/Framework')` instead of `require(RebelFrame/Framework')`
